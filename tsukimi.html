            <h2>TSUKIMI MOONCAKE</h2>
            <p>Dango is chewy white dumplings made from rice flour. Tsukimi dango is also made from the same ingredients but 
                normally stacked in a pyramid to represent an offering to the moon. To thank the gods for a bountiful harvest, 
                it is decorated with crops harvested in autumn such as taro, chestnuts, sweet potato with pampas grass. Tsukimi 
                involves many aspects of Japanese traditions and culture. One tradition that has carried on to this day is 
                the idea of rabbits pounding rice cakes on the moon. Because of this, rabbits are often decorated on mooncakes and other related items.</p>

                <p>Bake sweet potato with an oven or an air fryer until potato is cook. You will know when the potato is cooked 
                    by piercing it with a bamboo stick or fork. If it's cooked, It'll be easy to go through and slide off the fork.
                    Peel the potato skin while it is hot. Place the potato into a medium-size bowl, and mash the potato with a potato masher or spatula.
                    Add 10% of the sugar of potato weight. Mix well until sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer the potato paste into the small piping bag, and pipe it into the small size of a ball. 
                    Freeze them until the potato balls are completely frozen. Add shiratama ko and sugar together in a medium-sized bowl. Add water gradually, mixing well.
                    In another bowl, add jyoshin ko, gradually add hot water, mixing well by spatula. Add shiratama sugar dough into here, 
                    knead the two doughs until the mixture takes on the consistency of an earlobe.</p>

                    <p> Divide the dough equally into 16 to 20 balls. (each ball is about 10g). 
                        Flatten each ball in your palm, and lay the frozen potato fillings in the middle of the flattened ball. Fold the edge to seal the 
                        dumpling and lightly roll it into a dome shape like a rabbit's body. Set aside.Boil a lot of water. Add the mochi balls into the boiling water and cook for about 3 - 4 minutes.
                        When the mochi balls start to float, remove them from hot water into a bowl of cold water and cool them down.
