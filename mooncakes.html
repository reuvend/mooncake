	<h2>MOONCAKE HISTORY</h2>
	<p>Mooncakes have a rich history in East Asia, dating back over a thousand years. 
        The origins of mooncakes can be traced to ancient China, where they were first created 
        during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). Initially, mooncakes were simple, round pastries filled 
        with sweet bean or nut paste. Mooncakes evolved over time, incorporating various fillings such 
        as lotus seed paste, salted egg yolks, and even savory options. The intricate designs on the 
        mooncakes also became an art form. Over the centuries, the tradition of sharing mooncakes during
        the Mid-Autumn Festival spread to other East Asian countries like Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, each 
        adapting the treat to their unique culinary preferences. Today, mooncakes continue to symbolize 
        family reunion and good fortune, playing a central role in the cultural heritage of East Asia 
        during the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
