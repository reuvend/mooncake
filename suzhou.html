            <h2>SUZHOU-STYLE MOONCAKES</h2>
            <p>Su (苏) refers to the city, Suzhou (苏州) where it is originally from. 
                This mooncake has many layers of crust, kind of like a pastry. To 
                create that multi-layered structure, we have to make 2 different 
                kinds of dough. One is called Yousu (油酥), made with oil and 
                flour. The other one is called Shuiyoupi (水油皮), made with water, 
                butter, flour, and sugar. </p>

                    For the water dough, place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, except for the water. Start with half of the amount of water first. 
                    You may need all the water or more, you may not. Knead into a soft non-sticky dough. If it's too dry, you can add a bit more water.
                    Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes<br><br>
                    
                    Place all ingredients for filling in a mixing bowl. Use a chopstick in one direction until it forms a paste. Cover and set aside to chill 
                    in the refrigerator while you prepare the doughs.</p>

        <p>
            Preheat oven to 375 F (190C). Get one dough. Flatten in the middle and gather the two sides up to meet. Flatten with your palm.
            Use a rolling pin to roll it out into about 4-5 inch disc, slightly thicker in the middle. Scoop about 1 Tbsp of filling into the middle. 
            Wrap the dough around it and slightly pinch to seal. Place the seam side down and use your palm to gently flatten it into a disc, about 1-inch thick. 
            Repeat with the rest. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15 minutes and then flip over to let the other side brown, another 10-15 minutes. 
            Remove from the oven after that and let them cool down completely on the rack.</p>
